The objective is to improve the\\nstructure of the molecules to increase the binding afﬁnity so\\nthat the drug would work at lower dosages. Existing FSM\\ntechniques are not capable of extracting coverage-related\\nknowledge of patterns. However, if we develop approaches\\nfor discovering coverage-related knowledge patterns, such\\nmethods can be effectively used to help in optimizing the\\nbinding afﬁnity of the drug molecules w.r.t. the selected pro-\\ntein, thereby making the drug design process more efﬁcient.\\nA subgraph coverage pattern ( SCP) is a set (or pat-\\ntern), whose elements are the subgraphs of GTD. This work\\naddresses the problem of extracting all SCPs, which cover a\\ngiven percentage of the graph transactions of GTD. Notably,\\nin addition to the coverage aspect, we have to consider the\\naspect of overlap, which arises as a consequence of consid-\\nering the coverage of a set of subgraphs. The sets of graph\\ntransactions covered by the corresponding subgraphs of an\\nSCP may contain the common transactions, which we refer\\nto as overlap. In addition to coverage, we consider an SCP\\nis interesting if there is a minimal overlap among the graph\\ntransactions covered by subgraphs of an SCP.\\nGiven a GTD, the issue is to extract all of the possible\\nSCPs subject to the constraints associated with coverage and\\noverlap. A brute-force approach would be to ﬁrst extract\\nall of the possible subgraphs of GTD by employing a fre-\\nquent subgraph extraction algorithm [ 9,22,25,42] and then\\ndetermine the coverage and overlap for each possible pattern\\nconsisting of subgraphs. Intuitively, such an approach would\\nbe prohibitively expensive because the number of possible\\nsubgraphs in a given GTD typically explodes. Consequently,\\nthe number of candidate patterns to be considered for the\\nextraction of SCPs also explodes.\\nFor efﬁciently extracting SCPs from a given GTD, we\\nintroduce the model of SCPs and present the framework to\\nextract SCPs. In the proposed model, we deﬁne the notion\\nof coverage and overlap and present the problem to extract\\nSCPs. The problem is to extract all SCPs from a given GTD\\nby satisfying the threshold values of given coverage and\\noverlap. We present a framework to extract SCPs, which\\nwe designate as subgraph-identiﬁer-based ﬂat transactional\\n(SIFT) framework. As a part of SIFT framework, we propose\\nan approach to extract all subgraphs of the graph transac-\\ntions in GTD and assign a unique subgraph identiﬁer (SID)\\nto each subgraph. Next, each graph transaction in GTD is\\ntransformed into the corresponding ﬂat transaction, which\\nconsists of the corresponding SIDs. We also propose an\\napproach to extract SCPs from the ﬂat transactional dataset.\\nThe problem is similar to that of coverage pattern extraction\\n[36] from ﬂat transactional databases subject to coverage and\\noverlap constraints. Incidentally, overlap follows the sorted\\nclosure property [ 28], which we shall use in this work for\\nfacilitating effective pruning. Hence, we extend the exist-\\ning pattern extraction approach [36], which employs pruning\\nstrategy based on overlap, for the efﬁcient extraction of SCPs.\\nObserve that by forming a set of ﬂat transactions, complex\\ncomputationally intensive graph operations associated by\\ncoverageand overlap are replaced with the corresponding\\nsimpler and relatively fast set-based operations.\\nThe key contributions of this work are three-fold:\\n1. We introduce the notion of subgraph coverage patterns\\n(SCPs) for GTD.\\n2. We propose the SIFT framework for efﬁciently extracting\\nSCPs from a given GTD.\\n3. We conduct an extensive performance study using three\\nreal datasets to demonstrate that it is indeed feasible to\\nefﬁciently extract SCPs using our proposed SIFT frame-\\nwork.

The notion of coverage has\\nbeen used in hypergraphs in the form of the minimum hitting\\nset problem [7], which involves the extraction of the set of\\nvertices that have a non-empty intersection with every hyper-\\nedge.

The notion of coverage has been well explored to\\nsolve the maximum coverage problem in facility location\\n[6].

The issue of extracting the knowledge related to\\ncoverage from GTD has not been addressed. In contrast with\\nthe existing works [ 29,40,42], in this paper, we have made\\nan effort to propose an approach to extract coverage-related\\nknowledge from GTDs.\\n2.2 Background information\\nWe shall now discuss the model of subgraph discovery from\\ngraph transactions and coverage patterns.\\n2.2.1 Model of subgraph discovery\\nIn the literature, several efforts [ 4,8] are being made to dis-\\ncover the knowledge of subgraphs from the given set of\\ngraph transactions. In particular, in the area of bioinformat-\\nics, research efforts [ 22,42] have been made by modeling\\nchemical compounds as graph transactions. By considering a\\ngiven chemical compound as a single unit, the corresponding\\ngraph transaction represents chemical elements as vertices\\nand chemical bonds among them as edges. We ﬁrst present\\nthe notion of graph transactions and brieﬂy explain the sub-\\ngraph discovery approach, which was presented in [ 42].\\nA graph transaction G = (V ,E,L,l) is a labeled, con-\\nnected, simple and undirected graph, where V is a set of\\nvertices, E ⊆ V 2 is a set of edges, L is a set of labels and\\nl : V ∪ E −→ L, where l is a function for assigning labels\\nto vertices and edges. A graph transactional dataset (GTD)\\nD comprises n such graph transactions, where the value of\\nn is typically large. Notably, a vertex/edge may belong to\\nmultiple graph transactions in D. A portion S of a graph\\ntransaction G is called a subgraph of G.G i v e nG = (V , E)\\nand S = (Vs , Es ), we say that S is a subgraph of G or S\\nexists in G (denoted as S ⊆ G), iff Vs ⊆ V , Es ⊆ E, ∀(u,\\nv) ∈ Es −→u, v ∈ Vs .\\nExample 1 Consider a sample chemical compound shown in\\nFig. 1a and its equivalent graph transaction G=(V ,E,L,l)\\ndepicted in Fig. 1b.

It uses a pattern-\\ngrowth approach to build a hierarchical search tree called the\\nDFS Code Tree .I nt h e DFS Code Tree , every node repre-\\nsents a subgraph/graph, and any subgraph/graph in GTD can\\nﬁnd its node in theDFS Code Tree . Each node in the tree\\nis assigned with a lexicographical canonical label called the\\nDFS code and one subgraph can have multiple DFS codes.\\nThe ﬁrst DFS code in pre-order traversal over theDFS Code\\nTree is called the minimum DFS code and is assigned as the\\ncanonical label to the subgraph. Moreover, gSpan also prunes\\nall the nodes that contain non-minimum DFS code, thereby\\nreducing the size of theDFS Code Tree . A depth-ﬁrst search\\nover the DFS Code Tree extracts all minimum DFS codes\\nof all candidate subgraphs in D. The performance of gSpan\\nimproves drastically due to the merging of isomorphism test\\nand subgraph growth into one procedure.\\n2.2.2 Model of coverage patterns\\nWe shall now explain the concept of coverage patterns\\n[18,36]. Coverage patterns are characterized by the notions of\\nrelative frequency, coverage support and overlap ratio. Given\\na transactional databaseD, each transaction is a subset of a set\\nI of m items { i1,i2,i3,... , im }. T ik denotes the set of transac-\\ntions in which item ik is present. The fraction of transactions\\ncontaining a given item ik is designated as Relative Frequency\\nof ik (RF(ik )). Hence, RF(ik )= |T ik |\\n|D| . A given item is consid-\\nered as frequent if its relative frequency is greater than that of\\na threshold value, which we designate as minRF. A pattern P\\nis a subset of items in I, i.e., P⊆I where P={i p, iq , ... , ir },\\nwhere 1 ≤ p, q, r ≤ m. The Coverage Set (CSet(P))o fap a t -\\ntern P is the set of all the transactions that contain at least one\\nitem from the pattern P, i.e., CSet(P)=T i p ∪ T iq ∪ ... ∪ T ir .\\nThe Coverage Support of a pattern P (CS(P))i st h er a t i oo f\\nthe size of CSet(P) to the size of D, i.e., CS(P)= |CSe t (P)|\\n|D| .I n\\norder to add a new item to the pattern P such that the cov-\\nerage support increases signiﬁcantly, the notion of overlap\\nratio is introduced. (This is possible in the case when the\\nnumber of transactions, which are common to the new item\\nand the patternP, is low.) Given a pattern P, the notion of\\noverlap ratio of P satisﬁes the sorted closure property [ 28],\\nwhen the items in P are sorted in decreasing order of their\\nrelative frequencies, i.e., 1 ≤ RF (i p) ≤ RF (iq ) ≤ ... ≤\\nRF (ir ).T h e Overlap Ratio of a pattern P (OR(P))i st h e\\nratio of the number of transactions that are common between\\nCSet(P −ir ) and T ir to the number of transactions in T ir , i.e.,\\nOR(P)= |CSe t (P−ir )∩(T ir )|\\n|T ir | . A high value of coverage support\\nindicates more number of transactions and a low value of\\noverlap ratio means less repetitions among the transactions.\\nA pattern is interesting if its coverage support is greater than\\nor equal to the user-speciﬁed minimum Coverage Support\\nthreshold value (minCS) and its overlap ratio is less than or\\nequal to the user-speciﬁed maximum Overlap Ratio thresh-\\nold value ( maxOR). Given the values of minRF, minCS and\\nmaxOR, a pattern P={i p, iq , ... , ir } is considered as a cov-\\nerage pattern if RF(ik ) ≥ minRF ∀ ik ∈ P, CS(P) ≥ minCS\\nand OR(P) ≤ maxOR. By exploiting the sorted closure prop-\\nerty of overlap ratio, a level-wise apriori-based approach has\\nbeen proposed in [ 36] and a pattern-growth-based approach\\nhas been proposed in [ 18] for extracting all coverage patterns\\nfrom D,g i v e n minRF, minCS and maxOR values. Addi-\\ntionally, a MapReduce-based algorithm to extract coverage\\npatterns has been proposed in [ 32].\\nTo extract the knowledge of coverage patterns, the follow-\\ning heuristics can be followed for setting minRF, minCS and\\nmaxOR values. Normally, the coverage patterns with maxi-\\nmum coverage (100%) and minimum overlap ratio (0%) are\\ninteresting.

We deﬁne cover(Sj , Gi ) as\\nfollows:\\ncover(Sj , Gi ) =\\n{\\n1 ifS j ⊆ Gi\\n0 other wise\\n(1)\\nComputation of cover(Sj , Gi ) involves solving the sub-\\ngraph isomorphism problem [ 25], which is NP-complete\\n[16]. The gSpan algorithm [42] uses a canonical labeling\\nsystem called DFS lexicographical order, which assigns min-\\nimum DFS code to each graph as the canonical label. We\\ncompute cover(Sj , Gi ) based on DFS codes. The Cover\\nSet of Sj (CSe tg(Sj , D)) is deﬁned as the set of all graph\\ntransactions covered by Sj .

Regarding overlap, we consider that the SCPs with\\nminimum overlap will be interesting. Therefore, in a dense\\ndata set scenario, a smaller number ofSCPs will be returned\\nfor lower value of overlap. As overlap threshold increases,\\nthe number of SCPs explodes.\\n4 Proposed SIFT framework\\nThis section discusses our proposed SIFT framework.\\n4.1 Basic idea\\nGiven a GTD D and the threshold values of minRF g,\\nminCS g and maxO g as input, the goal is to extract all the\\nSCPs from D.\\nA brute-force approach would be to extract all of the\\npossible subgraphs of D based on minRF g, and then deter-\\nmine CS g and overlap g for each combination of subgraphs\\nby computing the corresponding CSe tg values of the given\\npattern. Each combination of subgraphs of D could be a\\ncandidate SCP. The number of candidate SCPs formed by\\nthe subgraphs of even a small number of graph transactions\\nwould essentially explode, thereby making the extraction of\\nSCPs extremely challenging and difﬁcult to scale.\\nThe basic idea is as follows. We convert the given graph\\ntransactions into the corresponding ﬂat transactions. For this\\npurpose, we extract all subgraphs from GTD and assign\\nunique Subgraph IDentiﬁers ( SID) to each subgraph. Next,\\nwe convert each graph transaction into ﬂat transaction by\\nincluding the corresponding SID. Next, we propose an efﬁ-\\ncient methodology to extract SCPs from ﬂat transactional\\ndataset. We shall henceforth refer to this framework as sub-\\ngraph ID-based ﬂat transactional (SIFT)f r a m e w o r k .\\nWe can intuitively understand that SIFT provides oppor-\\ntunities for efﬁcient determination of candidate sets. Further,\\nit provides efﬁcient way to compute coverage and overlap\\nfor each candidate set. This is because by considering each\\ngraph transaction as a set of SIDs, the coverage and over-\\nlap of a given subgraph pattern can be calculated through a\\nset-based operation. Thus, we are essentially replacing com-\\nplex and computationally expensive graph-based operations\\nby set-based operations, which are typically faster by several\\norders of magnitude. Hence, the problem of extractingSCPs\\nbecomes the problem of extracting combinations of SIDs\\nfrom the set of ﬂat transactions. Thus, we propose a pattern\\nmining-based extraction method by exploiting an overlap-\\nrelated pruning heuristic, which we shall discuss now.\\nIncidentally, CS g and overlap g threshold constraints do\\nnot satisfy the downward closure property [21]. However,\\nwe can exploit the overlap ratio measure proposed in [ 36]f o r\\nextracting coverage patterns from a ﬂat transactional dataset.\\nThe overlap ratio constraint satisﬁessorted closure prop-\\n Extracting subgraphs from D \\nD minRF\\nDf\\nExtraction of SCPs\\n \\nminCS maxOR\\nSCPs\\nFormation of SID-based flat transactions \\nFig. 3 Details of the SIFT framework\\nerty [28].

Incidentally, it can be observed that the\\nmaxOR constraint follows the sorted closure property, which\\nis explained below.\\nDeﬁnition 3 (Sorted closure property) Let the pattern X={Op,\\nOq ,..., Or , Os }, 1 ≤ p ≤ q ≤ r ≤ s ≤ m such that the\\nitems in X are sorted in the descending order of their rela-\\ntive frequency values, i.e., RF (Op) ≥ RF (Oq ) ≥ ··· ≥\\nRF (Or ) ≥ RF (Os ).I f OR (X) is less than or equal to\\nmaxOR, i.e., OR (X) ≤ maxOR , all the non-empty sub-\\nsets of X containing Os will also have OR less than or equal\\nto maxOR.\\nSuppose, we extract the set S of coverage patterns\\nfrom a given GTD with OR (X) ≤ α. We can compute\\noverlap g(X) for all X ∈ S and extract coverage patterns\\nwith overlap g(X) ≤ α. For a given pattern X, the relation-\\nship between OR and overlap g is given in Theorem 1.\\nTheorem 1 Consider a coverage pattern X={O 1,O 2,... ,\\nOp} with O R (X) ≤ α. Then, o verlap g(X) ≤ α, when\\np ≤\\n( 1+α\\nα\\n)\\n.\\nProof From the deﬁnition of overlap g in Sect. 3,\\noverlap g(X) =\\n( |M(X)|\\n|CSe t (X)| − 1\\n)\\n(5)\\nAs X is a coverage pattern, RF (O1) ≥ RF (O2) ≥ ··· ≥\\nRF (Op). We consider a worst case scenario and assume that\\n|CSe t (O1)|=| CSe t (O2)|= ... =| CSe t (Op|= t. So,\\nM(X) = p.t and CSe t (X) = p.t − (p − 1)αt. Substituting\\nthe values of M(X) and CSe t (X) in Equation 5,\\n( p.t\\np.t − (p − 1)αt − 1\\n)\\n= α(p − 1)\\np − α(p − 1) (6)\\nBy equating the above equation to α and solving for p,\\nα(p − 1)\\np − α(p − 1) = α;/equal1 ⇒p = 1 + α\\nα\\nThus, we conclude that for a pattern X, when OR (X) ≤ α,\\noverlap g(X) ≤ α if p ≤\\n( 1+α\\nα\\n)\\n. ⊓⊔\\nAlgorithm 3 : Compute_ SCPs(D f , minCS, maxOR)\\nInputs: D f : Set of ﬂat transactions;\\nminCS: Minimum coverage support;\\nmaxOR: Maximum overlap ratio\\nOutput: SCPs: Set of subgraph coverage patterns\\nV ariables: NO l :S e to f l-size non-overlap patterns; C1:S e to f l-size\\ncandidate patterns; X: Pattern; l:I n t e g e r\\n1: NO 1 ← Set of frequent elements sorted in decreasing order of their\\nrelative frequencies\\n2: l=2, SC Ps ← φ\\n3: while NO l−1 not empty do\\n4: Cl ← NO l−1 ⊿◁ NO l−1\\n5: for each pattern X ∈ Cl do\\n6: if OR (X, D f ) ≤ maxOR then\\n7: NO l ← NO l ∪ X\\n8: if CS (X, D f ) ≥ minCS then\\n9: SC Ps ← SC Ps ∪ X\\n10: end if\\n11: end if\\n12: end for\\n13: l ++\\n14: end while\\n15: return SCPs\\nNotably, we have employed two notions ( overlap g and\\noverlap ratio ) to capture the notion of overlap.

Coverage pattern mining\\nalgorithm exploits apriori like level-wise search approach to\\nﬁnd thel-size candidate patterns from ( l-1)-size non-overlap\\npatterns (see Lines 3–4). A non-overlap pattern is a pattern\\nthat satisﬁes maxOR constraint. It uses sorted closure prop-\\nerty to prune the search space and extracts all non-overlap\\npatterns, which become the candidates for the next iteration\\n(see Lines 5–7). The considered non-overlap patterns that\\nsatisfy the minCS constraint are considered as the SCPs (see\\nLines 8–9). This process is repeated until no new non-overlap\\npatterns are generated.\\nAfter extracting the set of SCPs, top- k SCPs can be listed\\nby considering a ranking criteria based on CS g or a combi-\\nnation of CS g and overlap g values of SCPs based on the\\nspeciﬁc requirements of the application domain.\\n4.3 Time complexity\\nThe time complexity of the proposed SIFT framework is\\nequals:\\nO(kmn + rm ) + O(mq ) +\\nm∑\\nl=1\\nl(|Cl−1|·| Cl−1|) (7)\\nwhere O(kmn + rm ) is the complexity of subgraph extrac-\\ntion, O(mn) is the time complexity of ﬂat transactions\\nmodeling, and ∑ m\\nl=1 l(|Cl−1|·| Cl−1|) is the time complex-\\nity of SCPs computation. The explanation of each term in\\nEquation 7 is as follows:\\nFirst, in SIFT framework, we employ gSpan algorithm\\nto extract subgraphs from GTD. As mentioned in [ 2], the\\ncomplexity of gSpan algorithm to extract all subgraphs from\\nGTD is O(kmn + rm ), where k is the maximum number\\nof subgraph isomorphism tests, m is the number of frequent\\nsubgraphs, n is the number of graph transactions, and r is\\nthe maximum number of duplicate codes of the frequent\\nsubgraphs that grow from other minimum DFS codes. It\\ncan be noted that extraction of all subgraphs from a given\\ngraph transaction is an NP-complete problem [2]. To improve\\nperformance, the gSpan algorithm employs the notion of\\nminimum DFS code and converting the subgraph extraction\\nproblem into a pattern mining problem through string com-\\nparison. In practical scenarios, the value of m ≤ n,t h ev a l u e\\nof r is much less than n and the value of k is small for sparse\\nand diverse labels. Hence, the time complexity for subgraph\\nextraction depends on the value of m × n.\\nSecond, the process to compute the ﬂat transactional\\ndataset from the set of <canonical label of a subgraph,\\nset of the corresponding GIDs > produced in the preceding\\nstep consists of two steps. First, we assign an SID to each\\nunique canonical label ( Clabel) and compute an hashmap\\n< SID ,Clabel >. The search time for the existence of\\nClabel in the hashmap take O(1). Second, after mapping the\\nClabel with unique SID, for each corresponding GID, we will\\ninsert SID into the corresponding ﬂat transaction identiﬁer.\\nThe search time to insert is O(1). Consider that on average,\\neach SID belongs to q number of transactions. The time com-\\nplexity to compute the ﬂat transactional dataset is bounded\\nby O(m × q). Notably, q ≪ m. Therefore, the time com-\\nplexity to model ﬂat transactions from graph transactions is\\nproportional tom.\\nThird, in SIFT framework, we employ an iterative level-\\nwise apriori based algorithm. The time complexity of an\\niterative pruning algorithm is∑ m\\nl=1 l(|Cl−1|·| Cl−1|), where\\n|Cl−1| is the number of candidate patterns of size l (Refer\\nto Chapter 6 of [ 38]). In the proposed SIFT framework, the\\nnumber of candidate patterns generated depends on the value\\nofoverlap ratio threshold maxOR. Normally, at lower values\\nof maxOR, less number of candidate patterns are produced\\nat each level.\\nOverall, the time complexity of proposed SIFT framework\\ndepends on the graph transactional dataset size n, number of\\nsubgraphs extracted m and number of candidate patterns gen-\\nerated. Note that the value of m depends on minRF threshold\\nand the number of candidate patterns depends on maxOR\\nthreshold. By choosing proper values of minRF and maxOR\\nthreshold values, it is indeed capable of extracting subgraph\\ncoverage patterns from graph transactional dataset.\\n5 Performance evaluation\\nWe conducted our experiments in the ADA cluster [ 1] (at IIIT\\nHyderabad), which consists of 42 Boston SYS-7048GR-TR\\nnodes equipped with dual Intel Xeon E5-2640 v4 processors,\\nproviding 40 virtual cores per node. The aggregate theoret-\\nical peak performance of ADA is 47.62 TFLOPS. We have\\nconducted experiments on 20 virtual machines. Each virtual\\nmachine is allocated with 2 GB memory. We also reported\\nthe experiments on the scalability aspect of our proposed\\napproach by varying the number of virtual machines from 5\\nto 40. We implemented our proposed schemes in Python 3.0.\\nThe link to the code for the implementation is provided in\\nthe footnote. 1\\nWe used three real datasets, namely Yeast 167 (Yeast anti-\\ncancer), P388 (Leukemia), from Pubchem [ 3,43] and Zinc\\ndataset consisting of drug-like molecules [ 37].

First, we\\nemploy the gSpan algorithm [42] for extracting all candidate\\nsubgraphs from a given GTD and assign SIDs to the extracted\\nsubgraphs. Second, we employ the proposed SIFT framework\\nto form the transformed ﬂat transactional dataset over the\\nextracted SIDs. Third, to extract SCPs from the transformed\\nﬂat transactions, we use the MapReduce-based coverage pat-\\ntern mining algorithm [32], which was proposed to extract\\ncoverage patterns from ﬂat transactions. Table 3 summarizes\\nthe parameters of our performance study.\\nThe performance metrics for extracting SCPs are (i) pro-\\ncessing time (TS) to extract subgraphs, assign SIDs and form\\nSID-based ﬂat transactions, (ii) number of candidate sub-\\ngraphs ( NS), (iii) average number of SIDs (AV G )i nt h e\\nSID-based ﬂat transactions, (iv) processing time ( TSC P )t o\\nextract SCPs from ﬂat transactions, (v) number of patterns\\n(NP ) to be examined for extracting SCPs and (vi) number of\\nSCPs (NSC P ). Here, TS represents the processing time con-\\nsumed to extract subgraphs by accessing the graph dataset\\nfrom the disk. TSC P is the processing time consumed for\\nextracting SCPs from the SID-based transactional dataset,\\nwhich resides on disk.\\n5.1 Effect of varying minRF\\nThe results in Fig. 4 depict the effect of varying minRF.T h e\\nresults in Fig. 4a indicate the performance of TS, while the\\nresults in Fig. 4b show the performance of NS as we vary\\nminRF for the P388 and Yeast datasets. The results in Fig. 4a\\nshow that when the value of minRF is low, the value of TS is\\nhigh. As minRF is increased, the value of TS reduces expo-\\nnentially due to the pruning effect of minRF.T h ev a l u eo fTS\\ndepends upon the number of subgraphs extracted from the\\ndataset. The results in Fig. 4b show that the number of SIDs\\ndecreases with increase in the value of minRF. This occurs\\ndue to decrease in the number of subgraphs that satisfy the\\nminRF constraint. The results in Fig. 4c depict the effect\\nof varying minRF on AVG. The results show that when the\\nvalue of minRF is low, the value of AVGis high, and as minRF\\nincreases, the value of AVG is decreased. This is because at\\nlower value of minRF, there will be a large number of sub-\\ngraphs, which satisfy the minRF constraint. As the value of\\nminRF increases, the number of subgraphs decreases because\\nless number of subgraphs satisfy the minRF constraint. The\\nvalue of AVG depends on the number of subgraphs that are\\nextracted. Therefore, at lower values of minRF, a transac-\\ntional dataset with large AVG is extracted.\\nThe results in Figs. 4d, e and f show that the values of\\nTSC P , NP and NSC P decrease with the increase in the value\\nof minRF, respectively. The reason is that at lower value of\\nminRF, there will be large number of subgraphs satisfying\\nthe minRF constraint. As minRF increases, the value of NP\\ndecreases because less number of patterns satisfy the minRF\\nconstraint. Consequently, the values of TSC P and NSC P also\\ndecrease.\\n123'),\n",

The results show that NSC P does not\\nvary much at lower values of minRF and maxOR. When we\\nincrease the value of minRF,t h ev a l u eo f NSC P decreases\\ndue to decrease in number of candidate pattern. When the\\nvalues ofminRF and maxOR are high, the value of NSC P\\nis less, due to less number of candidate patterns. However,\\nwhen the values of minRF and maxOR are high, the number\\nof SCPs explodes due to large number of candidate pattern\\ngeneration.\\n5.5 Effect of varying NM\\nFigure 9 depicts the effect of varying the number NM of\\nmachines. Observe that the value of TSC P decreases with\\nincrease in the value of NM . This is due to increase in the\\nparallel extraction of SCPs. However, the change in the value\\nof TSC P decreases with increase in NM and exhibits a satura-\\ntion effect when more than 30 machines are used. This is due\\nto communication overhead. The results show that the value\\nof TSC P can be reduced by employing additional resources.\\nGiven a dataset, the processing time to extract SCPs equals\\nthe sum of the processing time to form SID-based graph\\ntransactions (as depicted in Figs. 4a) and the processing time\\nto extract SCPs (as depicted in Fig. 9). Overall, the results\\ndemonstrate that it is feasible to extract the knowledge of\\nSCPs by processing a reasonable size dataset of Yeast with\\n79601 graph transactions.\\n5 1 01 52 02 53 03 54 00\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60TSCP (×103) (s)\\nminRF=0.3\\nminCS=0.7\\nmaxOR=0.3\\nNM\\nP388\\nYeast\\nFig. 9 Effect of varying NM\\n5.6 Discussion about setting thresholds in SIFT\\nIn this approach, conversion of graph transactions into SID-\\nbased ﬂat transactions is one time computation process. Once\\ngraph transactions are transformed to ﬂat transactions, it\\nis always possible to choose relative frequency thresholds\\ngreater than minRF g and compute SCPs for various values\\nof minCS g and maxOR g.\\nNow let us discuss how to set the values of the parame-\\nters such as minRF g, minCS g and maxOR g.T h e minRF g\\nthreshold value can be set to half the maximum minRF g\\nvalue. Then, based on number of coverage patterns, minRF g\\ncan be decreased. The goal is to extract SCPs with maximum\\ncoverage, while minimizing the overlap to zero. Hence, as\\na heuristic, we could start with the coverage support value\\nequal to 1 and then progressively keep decreasing the value of\\ncoverage support until a desired number of SCPs is obtained.\\nRegarding maxOR g, we can start with maxOR g equal to 0\\nand then progressively keep increasing the value of maxOR g\\nuntil a desired number of SCPs can be obtained.\\nBased on the application, the domain expert can ﬁrst\\nextract SCPs by setting maxOR=0 and minCS=1. If the\\ndomain expert needs more number of SCPs, he can increase\\nmaxOR or decrease minCS progressively. Normally, the pro-\\ncess of pattern mining is an iterative approach. As we have\\nproposed a pattern mining model, the usual methodologies\\nemployed to set threshold values can be employed in this\\ncase also.\\n6 Case study: usefulness of SCPs in drug\\ndesign\\nWe demonstrate the feasibility of applying knowledge of\\nSCPs in computer-aided drug design toward developing\\na drug for coronavirus.

Molecular docking procedure takes each of the\\n250000 molecules, identiﬁes the best binding mode with the\\nprotein, and gives the binding afﬁnity and the protein–ligand\\nbound complex (PLC) structure using a scoring function.\\nBetter the intermolecular interactions between the protein\\nand the ligand, better is the binding afﬁnity and better is the\\nmolecule for it to be a drug. The top-1000 molecules among\\nthe 250000 molecules in the initial dataset that yielded high\\nbinding afﬁnity with the protein molecule were chosen for\\nmining SCPs.\\nFor our case study, protein–ligand complexes (PLCs) are\\nconverted to graphs transactions using GReMLIN [ 34].

Given graph transactional data, existing\\nworks have focused on the problem of extracting frequent\\nsubgraphs, but they have not considered the problem of\\nextracting the knowledge of coverage-related subgraph pat-\\nterns. Hence, we have introduced the concept ofsubgraph\\ncoverage patterns . In particular, we have proposed the\\nSIFT framework for extracting subgraph coverage patterns\\nfrom graph transactional data based on minRF, minCS and\\nmaxO constraints. Our performance evaluation with three\\nreal datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed\\nscheme in terms of processing time and pruning efﬁciency.\\nWe have also demonstrated the feasibility of applying the\\nknowledge of SCPs through a case study in the bioinformat-\\nics domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work\\nto consider the extraction of subgraph coverage patterns from\\ngraph transactional data. Given the prevalence of graph data\\nmodeling, the proposed model of SCPs has a potentially huge\\nscope for opening up new avenues for the extraction of inter-\\nesting knowledge from graph datasets in several important\\nand diverse domains.\\nFunding The research of A Srinivas Reddy and P Krishna Reddy is sup-\\nported by India-Japan Joint Research Laboratory Project entitled “Data\\nScience based farming support system for sustainable crop production\\nunder climatic change (DSFS),” funded by Department of Science and\\nTechnology, India (DST) and Japan Science and Technology Agency\\n(JST).

Existing works address the problem of mining frequent subgraphs from\\nGTD. However, the knowledge concerning the coverage aspect of a set of subgraphs is also valuable for improving the per-\\nformance of several applications. In this regard, we introduce the notion of subgraph coverage patterns ( SCPs). Given a GTD,\\na subgraph coverage pattern is a set of subgraphs subject to relative frequency, coverage and overlap constraints provided\\nby the user. We propose the Subgraph ID-based Flat Transactional ( SIFT) framework for the efﬁcient extraction of SCPs\\nfrom a given GTD. Our performance evaluation using three real datasets demonstrates that our proposed SIFT framework is\\nindeed capable of efﬁciently extracting SCPs from GTD.

In graph theory, the notion of coverage has\\nbeen explored in the form of the minimum vertex cover prob-\\nlem [11,39], hitting set problem in hypergraph, traversals of\\na hypergraph [ 20], clique cover problem [ 19] and inﬂuence\\nmaximization problem [ 27,47]. The notion of coverage has\\nbeen used in hypergraphs in the form of the minimum hitting\\nset problem [7], which involves the extraction of the set of\\nvertices that have a non-empty intersection with every hyper-\\nedge.

In particular, in the area of bioinformat-\\nics, research efforts [ 22,42] have been made by modeling\\nchemical compounds as graph transactions. By considering a\\ngiven chemical compound as a single unit, the corresponding\\ngraph transaction represents chemical elements as vertices\\nand chemical bonds among them as edges. We ﬁrst present\\nthe notion of graph transactions and brieﬂy explain the sub-\\ngraph discovery approach, which was presented in [ 42].\\nA graph transaction G = (V ,E,L,l) is a labeled, con-\\nnected, simple and undirected graph, where V is a set of\\nvertices, E ⊆ V 2 is a set of edges, L is a set of labels and\\nl : V ∪ E −→ L, where l is a function for assigning labels\\nto vertices and edges. A graph transactional dataset (GTD)\\nD comprises n such graph transactions, where the value of\\nn is typically large. Notably, a vertex/edge may belong to\\nmultiple graph transactions in D. A portion S of a graph\\ntransaction G is called a subgraph of G.G i v e nG = (V , E)\\nand S = (Vs , Es ), we say that S is a subgraph of G or S\\nexists in G (denoted as S ⊆ G), iff Vs ⊆ V , Es ⊆ E, ∀(u,\\nv) ∈ Es −→u, v ∈ Vs .\\nExample 1 Consider a sample chemical compound shown in\\nFig. 1a and its equivalent graph transaction G=(V ,E,L,l)\\ndepicted in Fig. 1b.

A depth-ﬁrst search\\nover the DFS Code Tree extracts all minimum DFS codes\\nof all candidate subgraphs in D. The performance of gSpan\\nimproves drastically due to the merging of isomorphism test\\nand subgraph growth into one procedure.\\n2.2.2 Model of coverage patterns\\nWe shall now explain the concept of coverage patterns\\n[18,36]. Coverage patterns are characterized by the notions of\\nrelative frequency, coverage support and overlap ratio. Given\\na transactional databaseD, each transaction is a subset of a set\\nI of m items { i1,i2,i3,... , im }. T ik denotes the set of transac-\\ntions in which item ik is present. The fraction of transactions\\ncontaining a given item ik is designated as Relative Frequency\\nof ik (RF(ik )). Hence, RF(ik )= |T ik |\\n|D| . A given item is consid-\\nered as frequent if its relative frequency is greater than that of\\na threshold value, which we designate as minRF. A pattern P\\nis a subset of items in I, i.e., P⊆I where P={i p, iq , ... , ir },\\nwhere 1 ≤ p, q, r ≤ m. The Coverage Set (CSet(P))o fap a t -\\ntern P is the set of all the transactions that contain at least one\\nitem from the pattern P, i.e., CSet(P)=T i p ∪ T iq ∪ ... ∪ T ir .\\nThe Coverage Support of a pattern P (CS(P))i st h er a t i oo f\\nthe size of CSet(P) to the size of D, i.e., CS(P)= |CSe t (P)|\\n|D| .I n\\norder to add a new item to the pattern P such that the cov-\\nerage support increases signiﬁcantly, the notion of overlap\\nratio is introduced. (This is possible in the case when the\\nnumber of transactions, which are common to the new item\\nand the patternP, is low.) Given a pattern P, the notion of\\noverlap ratio of P satisﬁes the sorted closure property [ 28],\\nwhen the items in P are sorted in decreasing order of their\\nrelative frequencies, i.e., 1 ≤ RF (i p) ≤ RF (iq ) ≤ ... ≤\\nRF (ir ).T h e Overlap Ratio of a pattern P (OR(P))i st h e\\nratio of the number of transactions that are common between\\nCSet(P −ir ) and T ir to the number of transactions in T ir , i.e.,\\nOR(P)= |CSe t (P−ir )∩(T'),\n",

Addi-\\ntionally, a MapReduce-based algorithm to extract coverage\\npatterns has been proposed in [ 32].\\nTo extract the knowledge of coverage patterns, the follow-\\ning heuristics can be followed for setting minRF, minCS and\\nmaxOR values.

Therefore, in a dense\\ndata set scenario, a smaller number ofSCPs will be returned\\nfor lower value of overlap. As overlap threshold increases,\\nthe number of SCPs explodes.\\n4 Proposed SIFT framework\\nThis section discusses our proposed SIFT framework.\\n4.1 Basic idea\\nGiven a GTD D and the threshold values of minRF g,\\nminCS g and maxO g as input, the goal is to extract all the\\nSCPs from D.\\nA brute-force approach would be to extract all of the\\npossible subgraphs of D based on minRF g, and then deter-\\nmine CS g and overlap g for each combination of subgraphs\\nby computing the corresponding CSe tg values of the given\\npattern. Each combination of subgraphs of D could be a\\ncandidate SCP. The number of candidate SCPs formed by\\nthe subgraphs of even a small number of graph transactions\\nwould essentially explode, thereby making the extraction of\\nSCPs extremely challenging and difﬁcult to scale.\\nThe basic idea is as follows. We convert the given graph\\ntransactions into the corresponding ﬂat transactions. For this\\npurpose, we extract all subgraphs from GTD and assign\\nunique Subgraph IDentiﬁers ( SID) to each subgraph. Next,\\nwe convert each graph transaction into ﬂat transaction by\\nincluding the corresponding SID. Next, we propose an efﬁ-\\ncient methodology to extract SCPs from ﬂat transactional\\ndataset. We shall henceforth refer to this framework as sub-\\ngraph ID-based ﬂat transactional (SIFT)f r a m e w o r k .\\nWe can intuitively understand that SIFT provides oppor-\\ntunities for efﬁcient determination of candidate sets. Further,\\nit provides efﬁcient way to compute coverage and overlap\\nfor each candidate set. This is because by considering each\\ngraph transaction as a set of SIDs, the coverage and over-\\nlap of a given subgraph pattern can be calculated through a\\nset-based operation. Thus, we are essentially replacing com-\\nplex and computationally expensive graph-based operations\\nby set-based operations, which are typically faster by several\\norders of magnitude. Hence, the problem of extractingSCPs\\nbecomes the problem of extracting combinations of SIDs\\nfrom the set of ﬂat transactions. Thus, we propose a pattern\\nmining-based extraction method by exploiting an overlap-\\nrelated pruning heuristic, which we shall discuss now.\\nIncidentally, CS g and overlap g threshold constraints do\\nnot satisfy the downward closure property [21].

Coverage pattern mining\\nalgorithm exploits apriori like level-wise search approach to\\nﬁnd thel-size candidate patterns from ( l-1)-size non-overlap\\npatterns (see Lines 3–4). A non-overlap pattern is a pattern\\nthat satisﬁes maxOR constraint. It uses sorted closure prop-\\nerty to prune the search space and extracts all non-overlap\\npatterns, which become the candidates for the next iteration\\n(see Lines 5–7). The considered non-overlap patterns that\\nsatisfy the minCS constraint are considered as the SCPs (see\\nLines 8–9). This process is repeated until no new non-overlap\\npatterns are generated.\\nAfter extracting the set of SCPs, top- k SCPs can be listed\\nby considering a ranking criteria based on CS g or a combi-\\nnation of CS g and overlap g values of SCPs based on the\\nspeciﬁc requirements of the application domain.\\n4.3 Time complexity\\nThe time complexity of the proposed SIFT framework is\\nequals:\\nO(kmn + rm ) + O(mq ) +\\nm∑\\nl=1\\nl(|Cl−1|·| Cl−1|) (7)\\nwhere O(kmn + rm ) is the complexity of subgraph extrac-\\ntion, O(mn) is the time complexity of ﬂat transactions\\nmodeling, and ∑ m\\nl=1 l(|Cl−1|·| Cl−1|) is the time complex-\\nity of SCPs computation. The explanation of each term in\\nEquation 7 is as follows:\\nFirst, in SIFT framework, we employ gSpan algorithm\\nto extract subgraphs from GTD. As mentioned in [ 2], the\\ncomplexity of gSpan algorithm to extract all subgraphs from\\nGTD is O(kmn + rm ), where k is the maximum number\\nof subgraph isomorphism tests, m is the number of frequent\\nsubgraphs, n is the number of graph transactions, and r is\\nthe maximum number of duplicate codes of the frequent\\nsubgraphs that grow from other minimum DFS codes. It\\ncan be noted that extraction of all subgraphs from a given\\ngraph transaction is an NP-complete problem [2]. To improve\\nperformance, the gSpan algorithm employs the notion of\\nminimum DFS code and converting the subgraph extraction\\nproblem into a pattern mining problem through string com-\\nparison. In practical scenarios, the value of m ≤ n,t h ev a l u e\\nof r is much less than n and the value of k is small for sparse\\nand diverse labels. Hence, the time complexity for subgraph\\nextraction depends on the value of m × n.\\nSecond, the process to compute the ﬂat transactional\\ndataset from the set of <canonical label of a subgraph,\\nset of the corresponding GIDs > produced in the preceding\\nstep consists of two steps. First, we assign an SID to each\\nunique canonical label ( Clabel) and compute an hashmap\\n< SID ,Clabel >. The search time for the existence of\\nClabel in the hashmap take O(1). Second, after mapping the\\nClabel with unique SID, for each corresponding GID, we will\\ninsert SID into the corresponding ﬂat transaction identiﬁer.\\nThe search time to insert is O(1). Consider that on average,\\neach SID belongs to q number of transactions. The time com-\\nplexity to compute the ﬂat transactional dataset is bounded\\nby O(m × q). Notably, q ≪ m. Therefore, the time com-\\nplexity to model ﬂat transactions from graph transactions is\\nproportional tom.\\nThird, in SIFT framework, we employ an iterative level-\\nwise apriori based algorithm. The time complexity of an\\niterative pruning algorithm is∑ m\\nl=1 l(|Cl−1|·| Cl−1|), where\\n|Cl−1| is the number of candidate patterns of size l (Refer\\nto Chapter 6 of [ 38]).

First, we\\nemploy the gSpan algorithm [42] for extracting all candidate\\nsubgraphs from a given GTD and assign SIDs to the extracted\\nsubgraphs. Second, we employ the proposed SIFT framework\\nto form the transformed ﬂat transactional dataset over the\\nextracted SIDs. Third, to extract SCPs from the transformed\\nﬂat transactions, we use the MapReduce-based coverage pat-\\ntern mining algorithm [32], which was proposed to extract\\ncoverage patterns from ﬂat transactions. Table 3 summarizes\\nthe parameters of our performance study.\\nThe performance metrics for extracting SCPs are (i) pro-\\ncessing time (TS) to extract subgraphs, assign SIDs and form\\nSID-based ﬂat transactions, (ii) number of candidate sub-\\ngraphs ( NS), (iii) average number of SIDs (AV G )i nt h e\\nSID-based ﬂat transactions, (iv) processing time ( TSC P )t o\\nextract SCPs from ﬂat transactions, (v) number of patterns\\n(NP ) to be examined for extracting SCPs and (vi) number of\\nSCPs (NSC P ).

Coronavirus main pro-\\ntease enzymes (CoV-Mpro) are crucial for virus replication.\\nDrugs designed to inhibit this class of enzymes help in treat-\\ning coronavirus infection [ 45]. We consider Zinc database\\ncomprising 250000 drug-like molecules. We selected Mpro\\nprotein (PDB ID: 1WOF) using the Autodock 4.2 software\\nprogram [30]. Molecular docking procedure takes each of the\\n250000 molecules, identiﬁes the best binding mode with the\\nprotein, and gives the binding afﬁnity and the protein–ligand\\nbound complex (PLC) structure using a scoring function.\\nBetter the intermolecular interactions between the protein\\nand the ligand, better is the binding afﬁnity and better is the\\nmolecule for it to be a drug. The top-1000 molecules among\\nthe 250000 molecules in the initial dataset that yielded high\\nbinding afﬁnity with the protein molecule were chosen for\\nmining SCPs.\\nFor our case study, protein–ligand complexes (PLCs) are\\nconverted to graphs transactions using GReMLIN [ 34]. A\\nligand can interact with the same protein at different sites,\\nproducing multiple graphs for the same protein and ligand,\\nbut different vertex and edge label sets. Here, vertices are\\namino acids of proteins and atoms of ligands and the edges\\nare interactions between amino acids and ligands.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='International Journal of Data Science and Analytics\\nFig. 11 a Structure of the MPro protein bound to a ligand. b Six selected\\nprotein amino acids and interactions with a ligand molecule correspond-\\ning toS1 and S9 subgraphs c Protein–ligand interactions corresponding\\nto S11 subgraph\\nFigure 11b depicts an example of a ligand in which inter-\\nactions corresponding to S1 and S9 subgraphs are possible\\n(orange and pink arrows). As shown in Fig. 11b, it is evident\\nthat the method captured the hydrophobic interaction S1 and\\naromatic interaction S9, which contribute toward the favor-\\nable binding afﬁnity between the protein and the ligand. On\\nthe other hand, Fig.11c depicts the protein–ligand hydrogen\\nbonding interactions involving another ligand that represent\\nthe S11 subgraph. Similar to the aromatic and hydropho-\\nbic interactions above, the approach captures the hydrogen\\nbonded interaction efﬁciently. These three subgraphs have an\\noverall coverage of 83% with overlap ratio as zero indicat-\\ning their prevalence and hence importance for the molecules\\nto bind to the protein. Such a new knowledge gives possi-\\nble directions for improving the molecule by modifying the\\nstructure of these ligands so that multiple modes of interac-\\ntions are possible and hence, improve the binding afﬁnities.\\nTherefore, the proposed SIFT framework not only helps in\\nunderstanding the protein–ligand interactions, but also helps\\nin designing better drugs by extracting the knowledge of sub-\\ngraph coverage patterns.\\n7 Conclusion\\nSubgraph pattern mining is an active research area with\\napplications in the domains of chemical, biological and\\nsocial networks. Given graph transactional data, existing\\nworks have focused on the problem of extracting frequent\\nsubgraphs, but they have not considered the problem of\\nextracting the knowledge of coverage-related subgraph pat-\\nterns. Hence, we have introduced the concept ofsubgraph\\ncoverage patterns . In particular, we have proposed the\\nSIFT framework for extracting subgraph coverage patterns\\nfrom graph transactional data based on minRF, minCS and\\nmaxO constraints. Our performance evaluation with three\\nreal datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed\\nscheme in terms of processing time and pruning efﬁciency.\\nWe have also demonstrated the feasibility of applying the\\nknowledge of SCPs through a case study in the bioinformat-\\nics domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work\\nto consider the extraction of subgraph coverage patterns from\\ngraph transactional data. Given the prevalence of graph data\\nmodeling, the proposed model of SCPs has a potentially huge\\nscope for opening up new avenues for the extraction of inter-\\nesting knowledge from graph datasets in several important\\nand diverse domains.\\nFunding The research of A Srinivas Reddy and P Krishna Reddy is sup-\\nported by India-Japan Joint Research Laboratory Project entitled “Data\\nScience based farming support system for sustainable crop production\\nunder climatic change (DSFS),” funded by Department of Science and\\nTechnology, India (DST) and Japan Science and Technology Agency\\n(JST).

      "Question: **Section 1: Graph Mining and Subgraph Coverage Patterns**\n",
      "Answer: This section appears to be an introduction to the concept of graph mining and subgraph coverage patterns. Here's a breakdown of the content:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Graph Mining**: Graph mining is an active area of research that involves mining knowledge from graph representations in various domains such as bioinformatics, chemical informatics, social networks, computer vision, video indexing, text retrieval, and web analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Subgraph Mining**: Subgraph mining is an important area of graph mining that involves mining frequent subgraphs from graph transactional data (GTD). Frequent subgraph mining has been applied in bioinformatics to extract interesting patterns from GTD, providing valuable knowledge in the domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Subgraph Coverage Patterns**: The concept of subgraph coverage patterns (SCPs) is introduced as a new area of research. SCPs are sets of subgraphs that satisfy relative frequency, coverage, and overlap constraints provided by the user. The knowledge concerning the coverage aspect of a set of subgraphs is valuable for improving the performance of several applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Gap in Existing Research**: The authors highlight that existing works have addressed the problem of mining frequent subgraphs from GTD, but the issue of extracting coverage-related knowledge of patterns from GTD has not been investigated.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Motivation**: The authors believe that the coverage-related knowledge in the form of subgraph patterns can be used in improving the performance of applications in chemical, biological, and social network domains. They provide an example of how this knowledge can be applied in computer-aided drug design.\n",
      "\n",
      "=====================================\\n\\n\n",
      "Question: 1. How do graph mining techniques, such as frequent subgraph mining, facilitate the extraction of meaningful patterns and knowledge in bio-informatics and social networks, and what are the potential applications of this research in real-world scenarios, such as computer-aided drug design and optimization?\n",
      "Answer: Graph mining techniques, such as frequent subgraph mining, play a crucial role in facilitating the extraction of meaningful patterns and knowledge in bio-informatics and social networks. Here's how:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bio-informatics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Protein-ligand interaction patterns:** Frequent subgraph mining can identify conserved patterns in protein-ligand interactions, which is essential for understanding the mechanisms of protein functions and designing new drugs.\n",
      "2. **Molecular fragment discovery:** Graph mining techniques can extract molecular fragments that are relevant to specific biological activities, enabling the design of new molecules with desired properties.\n",
      "3. **Drug design and optimization:** By analyzing frequent subgraphs in protein-ligand interactions, researchers can identify key features that contribute to drug efficacy and optimize drug design.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Social Networks:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Influence maximization:** Graph mining techniques can identify influential individuals or groups in social networks, enabling targeted marketing campaigns or information dissemination strategies.\n",
      "2. **Community detection:** Frequent subgraph mining can help identify communities with similar interests or behaviors, facilitating personalized recommendations or social network analysis.\n",
      "3. **Network optimization:** Graph mining techniques can optimize social network structures to improve communication, collaboration, or information diffusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Potential Applications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Computer-aided drug design:** Graph mining techniques can accelerate the drug discovery process by identifying potential drug candidates and optimizing their design.\n",
      "2. **Personalized medicine:** By analyzing frequent subgraphs in protein-ligand interactions, researchers can develop personalized treatment strategies tailored to individual patients.\n",
      "3. **Social network analysis:** Graph mining techniques can improve our understanding of social networks, enabling more effective information dissemination, marketing, or policy-making strategies.\n",
      "4. **Biological network analysis:** Frequent subgraph mining can reveal insights into biological networks, such as protein-protein interactions, gene regulatory networks, or metabolic pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, graph mining techniques, such as frequent subgraph mining, are essential for extracting meaningful patterns and knowledge from complex data in bio-informatics and social networks. The potential applications of this research are vast, with significant implications for computer-aided drug design, personalized medicine, social network analysis, and biological network analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "=====================================\\n\\n\n",
      "Question: 2. What are the key differences between subgraph coverage patterns (SCPs) and traditional graph mining techniques, and how do user-defined constraints, such as minRF, minCS, and maxOR, influence the extraction of SCPs from graph transactional data (GTD) in terms of coverage and overlap?\n",
      "Answer: The key differences between subgraph coverage patterns (SCPs) and traditional graph mining techniques are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Focus on coverage and overlap**: SCPs focus on extracting patterns that cover a significant portion of the graph transactions in the GTD, whereas traditional graph mining techniques focus on extracting frequent subgraphs without considering coverage and overlap.\n",
      "2. **User-defined constraints**: SCPs are extracted based on user-defined constraints, such as minRF (minimum relative frequency), minCS (minimum coverage support), and maxOR (maximum overlap ratio), which influence the extraction process. Traditional graph mining techniques do not consider such constraints.\n",
      "3. **Pattern extraction approach**: SCPs are extracted using a pattern mining approach, which involves transforming graph transactions into flat transactions and applying a coverage pattern mining algorithm. Traditional graph mining techniques, on the other hand, use graph-based algorithms to extract frequent subgraphs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user-defined constraints, such as minRF, minCS, and maxOR, influence the extraction of SCPs from GTD in the following ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **minRF**: A higher minRF value ensures that only subgraphs with a higher relative frequency are considered, resulting in fewer but more frequent SCPs.\n",
      "* **minCS**: A higher minCS value ensures that only SCPs with a higher coverage support are extracted, resulting in SCPs that cover a larger portion of the GTD.\n",
      "* **maxOR**: A lower maxOR value ensures that SCPs with lower overlap among their covered transactions are extracted, resulting in more diverse SCPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "These constraints interact with each other to influence the extraction of SCPs. For example, increasing minRF and minCS values may lead to fewer SCPs being extracted, while decreasing maxOR values may lead to more diverse SCPs being extracted.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of coverage and overlap, the constraints influence the extraction of SCPs as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Coverage**: The minCS constraint ensures that SCPs cover a minimum percentage of the GTD, while the minRF constraint ensures that the subgraphs within an SCP have a minimum relative frequency.\n",
      "* **Overlap**: The maxOR constraint ensures that the overlap among transactions covered by subgraphs within an SCP is limited, resulting in more diverse SCPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "By adjusting these constraints, users can control the extraction of SCPs to suit their specific application requirements, such as extracting SCPs with high coverage and low overlap or extracting SCPs with high relative frequency and moderate coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "=====================================\\n\\n\n",
      "Question: 3. How does the SIFT framework utilize the sorted closure property of overlap ratio to efficiently prune candidate subgraph patterns and address the challenges of coverage and overlap in extracting SCPs from GTD, particularly in the context of chemical and biological applications?\n",
      "Answer: The SIFT framework utilizes the sorted closure property of overlap ratio to efficiently prune candidate subgraph patterns and address the challenges of coverage and overlap in extracting SCPs from GTD, particularly in the context of chemical and biological applications, in the following ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Efficient pruning of candidate patterns**: The sorted closure property of overlap ratio ensures that if a pattern X fails to satisfy the maximum overlap ratio threshold (maxOR), any superset of X cannot possibly satisfy the maximum overlap threshold. This allows the SIFT framework to prune candidate patterns efficiently, reducing the search space and computational complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Addressing coverage challenge**: The SIFT framework converts graph transactions into flat transactions, enabling the use of set-based operations to compute coverage and overlap. This approach replaces complex and computationally expensive graph-based operations with faster set-based operations, making it more efficient to extract SCPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Addressing overlap challenge**: The SIFT framework employs the overlap ratio constraint, which satisfies the sorted closure property. This property enables the framework to prune candidate patterns efficiently, reducing the number of patterns to be evaluated for overlap. The overlap ratio constraint also helps to identify non-overlap patterns, which are interesting in chemical and biological applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Exploiting the sorted closure property**: The SIFT framework sorts candidate subgraphs in descending order of their relative frequencies. Then, starting from individual candidate subgraph as SP, it generates candidate SP of progressively larger sizes, while using the pruning heuristic based on the sorted closure property of overlap ratio to efficiently prune candidate SP.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Applicability to chemical and biological applications**: The SIFT framework is particularly useful in chemical and biological applications, where extracting SCPs from GTD is crucial for identifying patterns in chemical compounds or biological networks. The framework's ability to efficiently prune candidate patterns and address coverage and overlap challenges makes it well-suited for these applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the SIFT framework utilizes the sorted closure property of overlap ratio to efficiently prune candidate subgraph patterns, address the challenges of coverage and overlap, and extract SCPs from GTD in a computationally efficient manner, making it a valuable tool for chemical and biological applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "=====================================\\n\\n\n",
      "Question: **Section 2: Graph Transactional Data and Frequent Subgraph Mining**\n",
      "Answer: This section discusses the concept of Graph Transactional Data (GTD) and Frequent Subgraph Mining (FSM).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Graph Transactional Data (GTD)**\n",
      "\n",
      "A graph transactional dataset (GTD) is a collection of graph transactions, where each graph transaction represents a complex graph structure. A graph transaction G = (V, E, L, l) is a labeled, connected, simple, and undirected graph, where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* V is a set of vertices\n",
      "* E is a set of edges\n",
      "* L is a set of labels\n",
      "* l is a function that assigns labels to vertices and edges\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of bioinformatics, a graph transaction can represent a chemical compound, where vertices represent chemical elements and edges represent chemical bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Frequent Subgraph Mining (FSM)**\n",
      "\n",
      "Frequent Subgraph Mining (FSM) is a technique used to discover frequent subgraphs from a GTD. A subgraph is a portion of a graph transaction that satisfies certain conditions. Given a GTD, a subgraph is considered frequent if it appears in a certain percentage of graph transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process of FSM involves:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Modeling chemical compounds as graph transactions\n",
      "2. Discovering frequent subgraphs from the GTD\n",
      "3. Extracting interesting patterns from the frequent subgraphs\n",
      "\n",
      "FSM has applications in bioinformatics, chemical informatics, and social networks. It can be used to identify patterns in protein-ligand interactions, chemical compounds, and social networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors cite several existing works on FSM, including [14, 17, 22, 23, 40, 42], which have demonstrated the effectiveness of FSM in extracting interesting patterns from GTD. However, the authors note that existing works have not addressed the issue of extracting coverage-related knowledge from GTD, which is the focus of their paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "=====================================\\n\\n\n",
      "Question: 4. How does graph transactional data enable the construction of knowledge structures, such as frequent subgraphs, and what are the implications for pattern discovery in bio-informatics and computer-aided drug design?\n",
      "Answer: Graph transactional data (GTD) enables the construction of knowledge structures, such as frequent subgraphs, by representing complex relationships between entities as graphs. In GTD, each graph transaction represents a single unit of data, such as a chemical compound or a protein-ligand complex, where vertices and edges represent entities and their relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The construction of knowledge structures from GTD involves mining frequent subgraphs, which are subgraphs that appear frequently in the dataset. These frequent subgraphs can represent interesting patterns or motifs that are common across multiple graph transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In bio-informatics and computer-aided drug design, the implications of pattern discovery from GTD are significant. For instance:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identifying key molecular fragments**: Frequent subgraphs can represent molecular fragments that are crucial for protein-ligand interactions, leading to the discovery of new drug molecules.\n",
      "2. **Understanding protein-ligand interactions**: By analyzing frequent subgraphs, researchers can gain insights into the interactions between proteins and ligands, facilitating the design of more effective drugs.\n",
      "3. **Optimizing drug design**: Pattern discovery from GTD can help optimize drug design by identifying subgraphs that are associated with desirable properties, such as increased binding affinity or improved solubility.\n",
      "4. **Predicting drug efficacy**: Frequent subgraphs can be used to predict the efficacy of drug molecules, enabling researchers to focus on the most promising candidates.\n",
      "5. **Accelerating drug discovery**: The use of GTD and pattern discovery can accelerate the drug discovery process by identifying potential drug molecules and their interactions more efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the construction of knowledge structures from GTD enables the discovery of valuable patterns and insights in bio-informatics and computer-aided drug design, ultimately leading to the development of more effective and targeted therapies.\n",
      "\n",

      "Question: 5. What are the applications of frequent subgraph mining in bio-informatics, and how can it contribute to the discovery of interesting patterns and the optimization of binding affinity in computer-aided drug design?\n",
      "Answer: Frequent subgraph mining has several applications in bioinformatics, particularly in computer-aided drug design. Here are some ways it can contribute to the discovery of interesting patterns and the optimization of binding affinity:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Protein-ligand interaction patterns**: Frequent subgraph mining can help identify conserved patterns in protein-ligand interactions, which are crucial for understanding the binding mechanisms of drugs to their target proteins. These patterns can be used to optimize the binding affinity of drug molecules.\n",

      "5. **De novo drug design**: Frequent subgraph mining can be used to generate novel drug-like molecules by combining frequent subgraphs in a way that optimizes binding affinity and other desirable properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of computer-aided drug design, frequent subgraph mining can contribute to the optimization of binding affinity by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identifying key binding interactions**: Frequent subgraph mining can help identify the key interactions between a drug molecule and its target protein, enabling the optimization of these interactions for improved binding affinity.\n",
      "2. **Optimizing molecular shape and electrostatics**: Frequent subgraph mining can be used to identify substructures that are associated with optimal molecular shape and electrostatic properties, enabling the design of drug molecules with improved binding affinity.\n",
      "3. **Predicting binding affinity**: Frequent subgraph mining can be used to develop predictive models of binding affinity, enabling the rapid screening of large libraries of drug candidates.\n",

      "Question: **Section 3: Coverage Aspect and Its Importance**\n",
      "Answer: This section appears to be discussing the concept of coverage in the context of graph transactions and subgraph patterns. It defines coverage support (CSg) as the percentage of graph transactions in a dataset (D) that are covered by at least one subgraph in a pattern (SP). The section also introduces the notion of overlap (g) between sets of transactions covered by subgraphs of a pattern, and defines overlap ratio (OR) as a measure of the overlap.\n",
      "\n",
      "The section explains that a pattern is interesting if its coverage support is greater than or equal to a user-specified minimum coverage support threshold (minCSg) and its overlap ratio is less than or equal to a user-specified maximum overlap ratio threshold (maxOg).\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems that this section is setting the stage for the rest of the paper, which will likely discuss algorithms and techniques for extracting subgraph coverage patterns from graph transactional datasets.\n",

      "Question: 7. What is the significance of the coverage aspect in improving application performance, and how does it relate to subgraph coverage patterns in GTD, particularly in the context of chemical and biological applications?\n",
      "Answer: The coverage aspect is significant in improving application performance because it provides valuable knowledge about the extent to which a set of subgraphs covers a graph transactional dataset (GTD). In the context of chemical and biological applications, the coverage aspect is crucial in understanding the interactions between drug molecules and target proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "In chemical and biological applications, the goal is to design drug molecules that can effectively interact with target proteins to treat diseases. The coverage aspect of subgraph patterns in GTD can help in identifying the most effective subgraphs that cover a significant portion of the graph transactions, thereby increasing the binding affinity of the drug molecules with the target proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coverage aspect is significant in the following ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Improved binding affinity**: By identifying subgraph patterns that cover a significant portion of the graph transactions, researchers can design drug molecules that are more likely to interact effectively with the target proteins, leading to improved binding affinity.\n",
      "2. **Optimized drug design**: The coverage aspect helps in identifying the most important subgraphs that contribute to the binding affinity, allowing researchers to optimize the drug design process by focusing on these critical subgraphs.\n",
      "3. **Reduced dosage**: By identifying subgraph patterns that cover a significant portion of the graph transactions, researchers can design drug molecules that are more effective at lower dosages, reducing the risk of adverse effects.\n",
      "4. **Increased efficacy**: The coverage aspect helps in identifying subgraph patterns that are more likely to interact with the target proteins, leading to increased efficacy in treating diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of GTD, subgraph coverage patterns are essential in understanding the coverage aspect of subgraphs in graph transactions. The SIFT framework proposed in the paper provides an efficient approach to extract subgraph coverage patterns from GTD, which can be used to improve the performance of applications in chemical and biological domains.\n",

      "Answer: The concept of coverage has its roots in set theory, graph theory, and transactional data, with theoretical foundations that enable knowledge extraction in various domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Set Theory:**\n",
      "In set theory, the concept of coverage is related to the set cover problem [12] and the hitting set problem [15]. The set cover problem involves finding the smallest subset of sets that covers all elements in a universal set. The hitting set problem is a variant of the set cover problem, where the goal is to find a subset of elements that intersects with every set in a collection of sets. These problems have been extensively studied in computer science and mathematics, with applications in data compression, clustering, and feature selection.\n",

      "**Graph Theory:**\n",
      "In graph theory, coverage is related to graph traversal, graph decomposition, and graph optimization problems. The minimum vertex cover problem [11, 39] is a classic problem in graph theory, where the goal is to find the smallest subset of vertices that covers all edges in a graph. Other graph problems, such as the clique cover problem [19] and the influence maximization problem [27, 47], also involve coverage concepts. These problems have applications in social network analysis, computer vision, and data mining.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Transactional Data:**\n",
      "In transactional data, coverage is related to pattern mining and association rule mining. The concept of coverage patterns was introduced in [18, 36] to extract patterns that cover a significant portion of transactions in a database. Coverage patterns are useful in identifying frequent itemsets, association rules, and sequential patterns in transactional data.\n",
